## Lab 4 â€“ Power BI

Scenario
========

Bellows College is an educational organization with multiple buildings on campus. Campus visitors are currently recorded in paper journals. The information is not captured consistently and there are no means to collect and analyze data about the visits across the entire campus. 

Campus administration would like to modernize their visitor registration system where access to the buildings is controlled by security personnel and all visits are required to be pre-registered and recorded by their hosts.

Throughout this course you will build applications and perform automation to enable the Bellows College administration and security personnel to manage and control access to the buildings on campus. 

In this lab, you will build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes data about campus visits.

High-level lab steps
======================

We will follow the below steps to design and create the Power BI dashboard:

-   Connect to Common Data Service 
-   Transform the data to include user-friendly descriptions for the related records (lookups)
-    Create and publish a report with various visualizations of the campus visits information
-    User natural language query to build additional visualizations
-    Build mobile view


## Prerequisites

* Completion of Lab 1 - Data Modeling

Things to consider before you begin
-----------------------------------

-   Who is the target audience of the report?
-   How will the audience consume the report? Typical device? Location?
-   Do you have sufficient data to visualise?
-   What are the possible characteristics you can use to analyse data about the visits?

Exercise \#1: Create Power BI Report 
===============================

**Objective:** In this exercise, you will create a Power BI report based on data from Common Data Service database.

Task \#1: Prepare Data
---------------------------

1.  Find out your organization URL

    * Navigate to Power Platform Admin Center at https://aka.ms/ppac.
    * In the left navigation page, select Environments, and then select the target environment.
    * Right mouse click **Environment URL** on the **Details** panel, then select **Copy link**.
2. If you do not have Power BI Desktop installed, navigate to https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore to download and install Power BI app.

3. Open Power BI Desktop, sign in if prompted.

4. Select **Get data**.

5. Select **Power Platform**, then select **Common Data Service**, and press **Connect**.

6. Paste the environment URL you copied earlier, press **OK**.

7. Expand **Entities** node, select **bc_Building** and **bc_Visit** entities, click **Load**.

8. Click **Model** icon on the left vertical toolbar.

9. Drag **bc_buildingid** column from **bc_Building** table and drop it to **bc_building** column in **bc_Visit** table. That will create a relationship between two entities that Power BI will be able to use to display related data.

10. Select **Report** icon on the left toolbar.

11. Expand **bc_Visits** node in the **Fields** panel.

12. Click ... and select **New Column**.

13. Complete the formula as following

    ```
    Column = RELATED(bc_Building[bc_name])
    ```

    and press ENTER. That will add a new field with the building name into the visits data.

14. Click ... next to the field and select **Rename**. Enter **Building** as the field name.

15. Click ... next to the **bc_visitid** field and select **Rename**. Enter **Visits** as the field name.

16. Click ... next to the **bc_scheduledstart** field and select **Rename**. Enter **Start** as the field name.

17. Save work in progress by pressing **File &#124; Save** and entering a filename of your choice.

## Task #2: Create Chart and Time Visualizations

1. Press pie chart icon in the **Visualizations** panel to insert the chart.
2. Drag **Building** field and drop it into **Legend** target box.
3. Drag **Visits** field and drop it into **Values** target box.
4. Resize the pie chart using corner handles so that all chart components are visible.
5. Click **New visual** on the Power BI ribbon then select stacked column chart in **Visualizations** pane. 
6. Drag **Visits** field and drop it into **Values** target box.
7. Drag **Start** field and drop it into **Axis** target box.
8. Click **x** next to **Day** and **Quarter** to leave only **Year** and **Month** totals.
9. Resize the chart as required using the corner handles.
10. Test the report interactivity:
    * Select various building slices on the pie chart and observe changes on the time report.
    * Select various bars on the time column chart and observe changes on the pie report.
    * Drilldown to the month level using icons or **Data/Drill &#124; Expand next level** ribbon command.
11. Save work in progress by pressing **File &#124; Save**.

Exercise #2: Create Power BI Dashboard
================================

## Task #1: Publish Power BI Report

1. Press **Publish** button on the ribbon.

2. Select **My workspace** as the destination, then press **Select**.

3. Wait until publishing is complete and click **Open \<name of your report\>.pbix in Power BI**.

## Task #2: Create Power BI Dashboard

1. Expand **My workspace**.
2. Select the report under **Reports** heading.
3. Select **Pin a live page** on the menu. Depending on the layout you may need to press **...** to show additional menu items.
4. Select **New dashboard** on **Pin to dashboard** prompt.
5. Enter **Campus Management** as a **Dashboard name**, press **Pin live**.
6. Select **My workspace** node, select **Campus Management** dashboard.
7. Test interactivity of the pie and bar charts displayed.

## Task #3: Add Visualizations Using Natural Language

1. Select **Ask a question about your data** on top of the dashboard
2. Enter **buildings by number of visits** in Q&A area. The bar chart will be displayed.
3. Select **Pin visual**.
4. Select **Existing dashboard**, select **Campus Management** dashboard, press **Pin**.
5. Test the behaviour by clicking on the chart to drilldown to Q&A.

## Task #4: Build Mobile Phone View

1. Select the report from **Reports** area.
2. Depending on the UI version select either **... &#124; Mobile View** or  **Web View &#124; Phone View**.
3. Rearrange tiles as desired.
4. Select **... &#124; Generate QR Code**.
5. If you have a mobile device, scan the code using a QR scanner app available on both iOS and Android platforms.
6. Navigate and explore reports on a mobile device.

# Challenges

* Dashboards and reports to include campus and building plans
* Report and analyze visiting patterns and trends
* Overstaying visualization
